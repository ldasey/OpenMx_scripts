The biometric LGC is an extension of the classic latent growth curve model. Instead of one individual, two individuals (monozygotic and dizygotic twins) are observed simultaneously. By fixing within-family covariation, the random part of the model (variances of the latent factors) can be decomposed into additive genetic factors (A), common environmental (C) and unique environmental influences.
