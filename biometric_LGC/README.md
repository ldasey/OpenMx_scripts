The biometric LGC is an extension of the classic latent growth curve model. Instead of one individual, two individuals (monozygotic and dizygotic twins) are observed simultaneously. By fixing within-family covariation, the random part of the model (variances of the latent factors) can be decomposed into additive genetic (A), common environmental (C) and unique environmental influences. It looks like this:

There are several variations. Some versions also decompose the residual variance if that is of interest. In my example the residuals are simply correlated within measurement occasion between twins. As visible in the path diagram, the path from the slope to the second measurement occasion is not fixed but rather estimated. It can be fixed to 0.5 to test for linearity. Another option, of course, is to create two separate slopes for linear and quadratic trajectories. However, with three repeated measurements variances of both slopes cannot be estimated simultaneously. The script also contains time-invariant covariates of sex and age which directly point to the measurement occasions (named sex_w1_T1 and age_w1_T1 in the script).
